<h2>Douglas Jung</h2>
<img src="Douglas.jpg" width="200px" class="Douglas">
<p>Frankly, Douglas Jung is the reason why I am able to study in Canada.<br/> Before 1967, Chinese Canadians were under great discrimination and there were always incidents in which a Chinese student got beaten to death by some white Canadians, but didn't receive justice.<br/> Some aspects of the discrimination Chinese Canadians faced included: not being able to be in the same shop with a white Canadian; forbidden from swimming in the same pool with white Canadians; and not being able to vote provincially nor federally.<br/> One shocking demonstration of the discrimination Chinese students faced was the 1923 Victoria school segregation. And because of some white agitators, the government promoted the Head Tax and the Chinese Exclusion Act, practically stoped Chinese from entering Canada.</p>
<p>Then Douglas Jung changed the lives of Chinese Canadians. He was the first person of Chinese descendent to be elected in the Parliament, along with other Chinese Canadians and white Canadians, he petitioned for the "point system". This point system was implemented in 1967, and people can come to Canadian despite their ethnicity, as long as they got more than 50 points in the TEST. The test focus on the fluency of either English or French of this person, the education he received and whether his profession is desired. It was after the implementation of the "point system" that Chinese Canadians were finally able to settle in Canada.</p>

Volunteered for Operation Oblivion, a British Special Operations Executive plan to send agents of Chinese background into Japanese-occupied China as spies and saboteurs, and to arm and train Chinese soldiers (see Chinese Canadians of Force 136). Because according to him"<em>“Some of us realized that unless we volunteered to serve Canada during this hour of need, we would be in a very difficult position after the war ended to demand our rights as Canadian citizens because the Canadian government would say to us, ‘What did you do during the war when everybody else was out fighting for Canada? What did you do?’ So a few of us volunteered to serve, and my group was probably the first to join up.”</em>"

The wartime service of Jung and other Chinese Canadian soldiers helped to overcome biased views held by mainstream Canadian society. In 1947, the British Columbia provincial government withdrew voting restrictions that had been imposed on Chinese Canadians.
